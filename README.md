## Game modes
In the "Agario" game mode, your objective is to avoid enemies bigger than yourself, and "eat" smaller enemies to grow in size.

The two other modes "Survival" and "Escape" are similiar, in these modes you respectively need to either avoid all enemies or eat all enemies.

## Creation
This game was created in form of a "gymnasiearbete" ("coursework") assignment winter 2016 at [NTI Gymnasiet Kronhusgatan, Gothenburg](http://www.ntigymnasiet.se/goteborg/teknikprogrammet/). The game is written and shown in English, while the documentation and comments are in Swedish.
