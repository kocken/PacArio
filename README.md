# PacArio
An "agar.io" inspired game where you, the player shown as a PacMan character, has the goal to gather as much points as possible until you lose. You do this by using the arrow keys or 'W', 'A', 'S' & 'D'. Depending on game mode, your objective is different.

## Game modes
In the "Agario" game mode, your objective is to avoid enemies bigger than yourself, and "eat" smaller enemies to grow in size.

The two other modes "Survival" and "Escape" are similiar, in these mods you respectively need to either avoid all enemies or eat all enemies.

## Creation
This game was created in form of a "gymnasiearbete" ("coursework") at [NTI Gymnasiet Kronhusgatan, Gothenburg](http://www.ntigymnasiet.se/goteborg/teknikprogrammet/). The game is written and shown in English, while the documentation is in Swedish.
